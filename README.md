Overview: 
For this third project, I am going to be developing 
a fully-functional React-based "todo list" web app. 
Optionally, I can use Redux for state management and 
React Router for navigation.

Functionality:
The only functioning parts of this app are the 
navigation bar and Todo list itself. Although
there isn't a Counter tracking function to
list completed, in progress, or incompleted items.
Still trying to work out contact form email connection.

Technologies used:
.jsx, .html, .css


Ideas for future improvement:
- No Procrastination
- Deliver a full functioning web app
- neat code
